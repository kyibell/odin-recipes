        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I experimented with lots of recipes over the years to find the best cripsy fried chicken. This is it! It's bits
            and pieces of hints I have heard over the years. It's more a matter or preparation and cooking method!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>four-pound whole chicken cut in pieces OR four pounds of breasts,drumsticks,wings,legs and/or thighs at the grocery store</li>
            <li>Acidic buttermilk tenderizes the chicken without making it too tough, and it also helps to stick the flour to the chicken.</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Seasonings (Paprika, salt and pepper). You can add more spices and seasonings to taste.</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil is perfect for frying chicken because it has a high smoke point.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the breading by combining flour, paprika, salt, and pepper into a zip-top bag. Seal the bag and shake well until combined.</li>
            <li>Dredge the chicken by pouring buttermilk into a shallow bowl. Once it's completely soaked, place the chicken in the flour mixture, seal, and shake well.</li>
            <li>Fry the Chicken by pouring the oil in a skillet and bring to high heat. Brown the chicken on both sides, then reduce the heat, cover the skillet, and cook for about 30 minutes. Fry until extra crispy, drain the chicken on paper towels.</li>
        </ol>
